50 Days 50 Front End Projects

I was on a speedrun of Brad Traversy's '50 Days 50 Projects' Udemy course.  07 days, 207 commits, and 8500 lines of codes later, I have recreated the projects in my style. 
I have also maintained the project codes in my GitHub repository. Feel free to clone or fork the repo and play around to make them even better.

Speaking about the course, it is a time-worthy project for intermediate-level front-end developers, as you will get to learn how to use DOM manipulation, JS event, and CSS pseudo selectors to create complex animations and widgets easily
